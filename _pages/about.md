🔬Expertise in molecular techniques (qPCR, digital PCR, LAMP), expecially for invasive species detection.
🍄Knowleadgeable about fungal wood degradation processes.

Currently a Research Fellow at CNR-IPSP (Florence), where I am involved in the 1LIVEXylella project.

🔍🦠In my work I'm tasked with the development and validation of protocols and technologies for the ultrasensitive detection of Xylella fastidiosa in both plant tissues and insect vectors.
🌲I'm also involved in many other projects on forest pathogens detection.

Most importantly, I'm very good at making pies.
