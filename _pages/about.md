🌱Plant pathologist with a dual PhD in Agricultural and Environmental Sciences.

🔬Expertise in molecular techniques (qPCR, digital PCR, LAMP), expecially for invasive species detection.
🍄Knowleadgeable about fungal wood degradation processes.

Currently a Research Fellow at CNR-IPSP (Florence), where I am involved in the 1LIVEXylella project.

🔍🦠In my work I'm tasked with the development and validation of protocols and technologies for the ultrasensitive detection of Xylella fastidiosa in both plant tissues and insect vectors.

🌲I'm also involved in many other projects on forest pathogens detection.

Recently I've started to get into bread-making and it's going pretty well.

About me
======
I received my PhD in july 2025 through a cotutelle program between the University of Florence (DAGRI) and Université de Haute-Alsace (LVBE) under the supervision of Prof. Mugnai Laura and Prof. Bertsch Christophe. In my dissertation I investigated the degradation capabilities of eight different basidiomycete fungi involved in the Esca Complex of Grapevine, with a focus on non-enzymatic degradation processes in white rot wood decay.
